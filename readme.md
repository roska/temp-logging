# Temperature logging

Temperature logger for Raspberry Pi using ds18b20 temperature sensor.

This will store temperature readings from sensors connected to the raspberry pi into mysql database.

This is a work in progress and not yet functional or usable.

*Status*: not working yet...



## TODO:
- add multi-sensor support
- create env.json-file for all environment variables (example file to be copied to..)
- database scripts / use orm..
